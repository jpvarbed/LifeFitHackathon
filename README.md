Changing your lifestyle is hard. Knowing the right combination of nutrition and exercise to get the most benefit of the change is even harder. Fitness trackers can tell you your current fitness level, but they cannot tell you what to eat or the best workouts for your fitness goals.
"FitList" is an app that works together with the data from your fitness tracker, your favorite workout partners and nutrition gurus, experts and health nuts to deliver custom exercise and nutrition guidance in one seamless, easy to use package.
When you sign up, FitList asks you questions about your lifestyle, connects to the services that you already use and recommends "FitLists" for you to follow. 
A "Fitlist" includes curated meals and workouts, scheduled for a full week, removing the hassle of planning for you. When you "play" a FitList, the app displays a week view to get you started.
The week view shows a grocery list so you can easily shop for the week or order via your favorite grocery delivery service. Additionally, the week view tells you which workouts to sign up for with your ClassPass or when to take a jog and attend CrossFit.
Each day the app shows what meals and workouts are upcoming and reminds you to complete tasks so you don't miss a beat. It also tracks your progress for that Fitlist over the week.  The power behind FitList is its ability to recommend an exercise and nutrition regimen based on you and keep you on track by reminding you what to eat and do daily.
FitList saves the time users previously needed to research and plan their meals and exercise for the week so they can stay laser focused on actually changing their lifestyle and achieving their fitness goals.
